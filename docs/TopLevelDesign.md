### General Ideas

- Score based like flappy bird or other mobile games
- Physics based

Miniature golf like game where there are a certain number of strokes to make it to the hole and if the player doesn't make it to the hole then the game
is over. However many holes the player gets before gameover is their score. Include different powerups and obstacles on the course that can help or hinder the player's ability to get the ball into the hole. 

Each hole should be able to fit onto one screen so that camera management is not necessary to implement.

In order to hit the ball, the user will click on the ball and drag the mouse in a direction. An arrow will appear showing the direction of the ball and the length of the arrow will show the magnitude of force that will be applied on hit.
