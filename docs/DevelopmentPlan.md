# Software Development Plan
All work for this project will be carried out by one student. There are five phases to developing the game: learning / demoing Godot, designing the top level of the game's design (non programming parts), designing the lower level of the game's design (programming parts), development, and game testing. At this point, there are two week until the project needs to be fully finished, so each phase of development will be broken down into the following time intervals:

- Godot learning and demos : 2 days
- Top level design : 2 days
- Lower level design : 2 days
- Development : 4 days
- Testing : 2 days

For time's sake, Godot learning and top level design will occur consecutively.
