# 437 Final Project

This repo contains the final project for the CSCI 437 Intro to 3D Graphics course. Everything about the project is described in the docs directory. Each document is explained here.

### Running and Playing the Game

Download the files for your platform from the builds folder. Builds have been made for Windows Desktop, MacOSX, and Linux/X11. For Windows: Download PeytonMathisWindows.exe, PeytonMathisWindows.pck, and libgitapi.dll. For Linux: Download PeytonMathisLinux.x86_64 and PeytonMathisLinux.pck. For MacOSX: Download PeytonMathisMacOSX.zip. Put all of the downloaded files in the same directory and run the respective executable. 

To play the game, click on the ball with the mouse and drag away from the ball. This will create an arrow showing the trajectory for the ball. On release, you will hit the ball in the direction of the arrow.

### DevelopmentPlan.md

This document describes the Software Engineering plan for how the game was developed. It describes the goals and schedule of the development of the game.

### TopLevelDesign.md

This document describes the top level design of the game. This has everything to do with the game's design that has nothing to do with how it is programmed. The general concept of the game, user interface, levels, powerups, obstacles, etc. are described here.

### LowerLevelDesign.md

This document describes the lower level design of the game. This deals with how the game is programmed. The game's different scenes, main scene, sprites and sprite interactions, and deployment are described here. Information about the game engine used (Godot) and why it was chosen is described here as well.

### GameState.pdf

This is a State Transition diagram that describes what each state in the game is and how they are all transitioned.

## A Note on Quality

I have been sick in bed with Covid for the last two weeks. I was expecting to get better sooner in order to get some more work done on this project, but unfortunately I have not gotten much better. Needless to say the quality of this project in its current state is not what I would have hoped, but it is what it is with me being sick and unable to work on the project. I definitely plan on adding more to this when I get better and I plan on having a much better final project next semester when I won't be stuck in bed (hopefully).
